# 🇵🇭 Pinoy Tsunami: Takbuhan ng Bayanihan 🏃‍♂️🏠🌊

**Pinoy Tsunami** is a fast-paced 2D endless runner proudly made by Filipinos, for everyone. You control a growing **horde of Pinoys** carrying a **bahay kubo-style tower** on their heads—running, jumping, and surviving waves of obstacles together. It’s a game of **bayanihan**, quick reflexes, and strategic teamwork.

## 💡 Inspirasyon

Inspired by the Filipino spirit of **bayanihan**—where neighbors help one another by literally carrying homes—**Pinoy Tsunami** reimagines that unity in an adrenaline-filled arcade game.  
It's fast. It's fun. It's *sariling atin*.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

> "Ang lakas ng bayan ay nasa pagkakaisa."

- **Auto-Run**: Your horde runs continuously from left to right.
- **One-Tap Control**: A single tap or key makes the whole group jump—sabay-sabay.
- **Recruit & Grow**: Meet fellow Pinoys on the road. Run into them, and they'll *sama sa tropa*!
- **Avoid Obstacles**: Gaps, walls, and traps are everywhere. Maling talon? Goodbye kaibigan!
- **House = Buhay**: The house is your lifeline. Too much damage or zero horde = Game Over.

### 💥 Peligro sa Daan
- Avoid obstacles or lose part of your horde.
- The longer you last, the faster and harder it gets.

### ➕ Rekrut Para sa Bayan
- Random Pinoys along the road can join you.
- Every person adds to your strength—**dagdag lakas, dagdag buhay**.

### 🏚️ Sirang Bahay (Optional Mechanic)
- Some hazards also crack or break parts of the house.

- Pag nasira ang bahay—tapos ang laban.

## 🧠 Diskarteng Pinoy

- **Lakas ng Loob**: Dare to reach lone recruits but avoid obstacles.
- **Jump Timing**: Minsan kailangan ng *tamang talon*, minsan ng *pasensya*.
- **Tropa Management**: The more you lose, the weaker your run becomes. Every kababayan counts.
